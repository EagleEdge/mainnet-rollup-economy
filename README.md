# mainnet-rollup-economy

In this repository, I analyze the dynaminc interplay between Ethereum mainnet and layer 2 rollups in the context of transaction fee and demand. Three research questions I want to explore are as follows:

1. How does the transaction fee on Ethereum mainnet affect demands on mainnet and layer 2 rollups?
2. How does the demand on the mainnet affect transaction fees on mainnet and layer 2 rollups?
3. How does the transaction fee on layer 2 rollups affect the demands on mainnet and layer 2 rollups?

I will start by collecting data on block-level and transaction-level using web3 API.
